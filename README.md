## A Prediction Model of Detecting the Liver Diseases in  Patients using Logistic Regression of Machine Learning

_Liver Diseases are prevalent in India accounting for 2.4% of Indian deaths per year_.
_As per the World Health Organization liver disease is the tenth most common cause of death in India_.
_Liver diseases have become a menacing threat in India with around 10 lakh patients being newly diagnosed with it every year_.

**Data Set Description**:
  The given data set comprises of 583 Indian Patient details, it consists 10 variables of which 1 is a dependent variable, and the remaining 9 are independent variables used for predicting whether the person is affected by liver disease or not.
  The dependent variable is “is patient” which is indicated as ‘1’ for predicting yes (i.e. It is predicted that the patient has liver disease)  and ‘2’ for no (i.e. It is predicted that the patient does not have liver disease)  which are converted to ‘1’ for yes and ‘0’ for no respectively.
